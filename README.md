<h1>jQuery Assignment: Crystal Collector</h1>

<h4>In this assignment, you'll create another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, your app must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.</h4>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>

<li>There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
<li>The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
<li>When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
<li>Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When they do click one, update the player's score counter.


<li>The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
<li>The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

<li>The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
<li>When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

<li>The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
 
 <h4>Designe note:</h4>
 <li>The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
<li>Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
